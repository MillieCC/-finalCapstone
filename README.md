"# -finalCapstone" 
Introduction of Capstone Project:
The sentiment analysis capstone project aims to develop a Python program for analyzing sentiments in Amazone product reviews from customers. By using the spaCy library, the project will preprocess text data i.e. Product data and customer feedback, implementing a sentiment analysis model, and evaluating its accuracy. Sentiment analysis holds significant importance for businesses as it allows them to gauge customer feedback and make data-driven decisions to enhance product offerings and customer satisfaction.

Installation:
1. Install spaCy
2. Download the spaCy English model
3. Install TextBlob for polarity analysis

Usage of program:
After setting up the environment, follow these steps to use the project.
1. Ensure the dataset "amazon_product_reviews.csv" is in the project directory.
2. Use Python script named "sentiment_analysis.py".
3. Implement the sentiment analysis functions as described in the project guidelines.
4. Execute the script to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews.

Result of analysis:
The sentiment analysis provided insights into the sentiments expressed in the Amazon product reviews. By evaluating the polarity scores, the program determined whether the reviews positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

The sentiment analysis model demonstrated effectiveness in understanding customer sentiments, thereby enabling businesses to derive actionable insights for product improvement and customer satisfaction enhancement.

Note the program contains limitations such as incorrect interpretation on ambigious customer feedback. Further enhancement and fine-tuning required to improve the model's performance.
